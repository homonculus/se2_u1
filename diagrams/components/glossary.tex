\subsection{Glossary}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Memory : a game in which a grid of blank boxes is displayed. Players select two cards in consecutive order a card, which 'flips' the card to reveal the 'content side'. If the two 'content sides' match, the player receives a point. The player with the most matches wins. If the two 'content sides' do not match, the two revealed cards flip back to the 'blank side', and the next players flip two cards.
	\item Content side : The side of a 'card' which contains information fed from teacher input data, which must be matched with another 'content side' during gameplay.
	\item Player : a student who is involved in active game play.
	\item Teams : two players that act as a single unit, collaborating on an x, y axis to select a single 'card' to be flipped.
	\item Game administrator : in this case, the teacher who is responsible for selecting game parameters such as time limits and number players/teams.
	\item Kinect : sensor from microsoft with depth sensors and rgb camera which is used as a game controller to register player movement/selections
	\item Depth sensors : allows to register three dimensional movement. Rather than rgb values at each pixel, a milimeter depth value is returned at each pixel value.
	\item Game content : a csv table allowing for input of education content by teachers at the school. Each row represents a pair of memory cards which must be matched during game play.
